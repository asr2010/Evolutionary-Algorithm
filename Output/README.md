This README file provides an overview of the output files included in this folder, which were generated during the course of our final project. 
Note that the organization of these files may not be optimal, as they were not originally intended for final submission.

Important Note: In the code blocks responsible for creating confusion matrices plot, you may notice hard-coded values. These values are present because we only created the confusion matrix array during the initial run. 
Later, we utilized the generated matrix from the initial run to create the plots.

Below is the folder structure and details of those respective files:

* ACO
	* Run 1 
		ACO_out.txt: 		Remote server output, displaying hyperparameter values found by the algorithm.
		ACO_HPO_1_Ouput.ipynb: 	Final accuracy and plot derived from training the CNN with obtained hyperparameters.
	* Run 2 
		ACO_hyperParameterOptimization.ipynb: Comprehensive output file.

* GA
	* Run 1 
		ga_putty.log: 		Remote server output, displaying hyperparameter values found by the algorithm.
		GPO_hpo_Output.ipynb: 	Final accuracy and plot derived from training the CNN with obtained hyperparameters.
