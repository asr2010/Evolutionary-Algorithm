# Evolutionary-Algorithm

This study investigates the use of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) to optimize the hyperparameters of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for multiclass image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. We explored three EA techniques, namely Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), for searching the optimal hyperparameters. Results demonstrate that the EAs improved the model's performance by tuning the CNN hyperparameters, with PSO achieving the best results. This work highlights the potential benefits of applying EAs to hyperparameter optimization in CNNs for image classification tasks.
